# gopro-eclipse-overlay

A module to extract GPS information embedded in a GoPro 5 or later MP4 file. Optimized to show data associated with the April 8, 2024 eclipse.

## Background

I had the opportunity to make a skydive during the 2024 total eclipse in North America.  I filmed the event using my GoPro 9.  

GoPro 5 and later has a GPS feature which, when enabled, will log your GPS position along with other hidden data into the recorded MP4 file.  As I watched an early draft of my video, I could see things get darker as the plane climbed to jump altitude, but I felt like some important context was missing. 

So, I had the idea to extract that data and use it to add an overlay on the video which would show the extent of the moon's eclipsing of the sun during the entire video.
